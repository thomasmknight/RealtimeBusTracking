# RealtimeBusTracking
This code tracks the current location of a single MBTA bus, adds a marker to that location, and recenters the window. 

## Usage
The toggle button switches between busses, which each have their own color designation. Currently, markers are added and not replaced, though this will be rectified in a future edit.
